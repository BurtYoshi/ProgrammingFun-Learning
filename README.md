A collection of projects that I am making to learn coding basics when bored during my programming class.
Might be more formal at a later date but it's literally just make this basic game and stick it in the repository.
 
Current dev. plan: Final revisions to the DR game then decide between RPS and BJ which to be completed first

Future features to add: 

 (RPS) Infinite game, score tracking wins and losses, calculate winner of each round,

 (BJ) How to score the cards (index #?), decide score in real time, basic game rules coded

 (DR) Use strings to progress game rather than negative integers, general optimization

 (GTN) Use strings to progress game rather than negative integers, general optimization
