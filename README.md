A collection of projects that I am making to learn coding basics when bored during my programming class.
Might be more formal at a later date but it's literally just make this basic game and stick it in the repository.
Features are never in order and may never be added, it depends on how I feel

Future features to add in the future: 

 1. (BJ) How to score the cards (index #?), decide score in real time, basic game rules coded (unsure on everything about this project)

 2. (RPS) Infinite game, score tracking wins and losses, calculate winner of each round 

 3. (DR) Use strings to progress game rather than negative integers, general optimization
