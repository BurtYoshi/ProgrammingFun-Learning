A collection of projects that I am making to learn coding basics when bored during my programming class.
Might be more formal at a later date but it's literally just make this basic game and stick it in the repository.
 
Current dev. plan: Final revisions to the DR game then decide between RPS and BJ which to be completed first
Future features to add: 
 (DR) allow decision to be edited rather than just ending the game. allow the game to be infinite, \n before last printed line, multiple dice type rolled at once
 (RPS) infinite game, score tracking wins and losses, calculate winner of each round,
 (BJ) how to score the cards (index #?), draw cards when prompted by the user and decide score in real time, basic game rules coded
