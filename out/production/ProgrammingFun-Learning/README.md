A collection of projects that I am making to learn coding basics when bored during my programming class.
 Might be more formal at a later date but it's literally just make this basic game and stick it in the repository.
 
<<<<<<< HEAD
 Current dev. plan: Starting work on RPS and BJ, will decide which route to go from there. (Likely will be BJ)
 Future plans: (DR) allow decision to be edited rather than just ending the game. allow the game to be infinite, \n before last printed line
